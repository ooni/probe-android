        <source>By running ooniprobe, you will examine the blocking of websites, your network's speed and performance, and whether systems that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance are in your network.</source>

        <source>These tests have been developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), a free software project (under The Tor Project) that aims to uncover Internet censorship around the world.</source>

      <trans-unit id="intro4">
        <source>Since 2012, OONI has collected millions of network measurements across more than 190 countries, shedding light on multiple cases of network interference. By running ooniprobe, you will help increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world.</source>

        <source>OONI's Web Connectivity test is designed to examine whether access to sites is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. By running this test, you will collect data that can serve as evidence of Internet censorship, and you will be provided with circumvention tips.</source>

        <source>OONI publishes all network measurement data that it collects because open data allows third parties to conduct independent studies, verify OONI findings and/or to answer other research questions. Such data also helps increase transparency of Internet censorship around the world. All data is published on OONI Explorer: https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/</source>

      <trans-unit id="disclaimer">
        <source>Please note: Running ooniprobe might be against the terms of service of your ISP or legally questionable in your country. By running ooniprobe you will connect to web services which may be banned, and use web censorship circumvention methods such as Tor. The OONI project will publish data submitted by probes, possibly including your IP address or other identifying information. In addition, your use of ooniprobe will be clear to anyone who has access to your computer, and to anyone who can monitor your Internet connection (such as your employer, ISP or government).</source>
